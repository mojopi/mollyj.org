<div class="work-description">
    <p>In 2016-17 sprout ran a <a href="http://thesprouts.github.io/healey/">pilot program</a> at the Healey School, a K-8 school in Somerville, MA. We worked with the 7th and 8th grade team to a different, project-based program every three weeks. </p>
    <p>In each program, young people did projects of their own designs based around a theme that we developed with the 7/8 grade teachers. In a math class we ran a program about moving machines. Each person designed and built something that moves including kinetic sculptures, trebuchets, puppets, RC cars, etc. In an English class, we ran programs where we made films about the invisible forces that shape our lives along with adaptations (stopmotion and live action movies) of fables, fairytales, and other stories we love.</p>
    <p>Below is a video that shows some of the projects from the year. </p>
