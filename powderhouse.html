    <p>I spent three years working with a team to start Powderhouse Studios, which was meant to be a new kind of public school in Somerville, MA.</p>

    <p>Here are the <a href="https://thesprouts.github.io/healey/">pilot programs</a> I ran in the Somerville school district at the Healey School and <a href="http://powderhouse.org/">here</a> is our organizational website which describes our philosophy, approach, and school design.
