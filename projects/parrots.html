<p class="title">Who are they?</p>

<br><br>
Parrots are highly expressive and emotional creatures. I've develped an appreciation for them while working at an incredible parrot sanctuary, <a href="https://www.fosterparrots.com/">Foster Parrots</a>, in Rhode Island. 

<br><br>
When I started observing the parrots, I became fascinated by the way they reacted to different people and each other. Their body language is so expressive and foreign. It's so alien to me that before really delving into it, I've begun researching their anatomy, their vision, and their cognition. 

<br><br>
I've been filming and photographing them to get better at observing them.

<p>
The short film below highlights some of the body language that I find striking. I made it black-and-white because their colors are so beautiful that they can become distracting from seeing what the parrots are actually <i>doing</i>. 

<br><br>

From the few films I've seen, I'm inspired by the film maker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Wiseman">Frederick Wiseman</a>. His films about institutions feel quite unmediated and more like biographies than documentaries.  I'd like to learn more about his films and process so that I can keep them in mind as I work to get better at <i>showing</i> the intelligences and emotional expressions of different animmals.

<p id="avian-awareness" class="title">Awareness of the Avian</p>
<h2>Growing my understanding of parrots</h2>

<br>

<p>
I’ve never thought of myself as a “bird person.” Historically, I’ve been more of a marine mammal fan.  Dolphins and whales have been my obsession since childhood. They’re simultaneously alien and human. Their vocalizations, signature whistles, enjoyment of physical contact, social lifestyle,  tool use, parental care, echolocation, voluntary breathing — it’s a mosaic of qualities and ways of being which feel simultaneously familiar and foreign. When I look at them and they look back at me, I get this feeling of  mutual engagement: it feels like they’re really looking.


<br><br>
Similar experiences of communion are often described with apes, elephants, and octopuses. I’m sure this experience would be more frequent with more species if we were open to different ways of seeing and knowing. But we privilege human ways of knowing over that of a fish or an octopus. Despite thinking highly of myself as open-minded, I’d never considered communing with a bird… until recently.

<br><br>

I volunteer at a parrot sanctuary called Foster Parrots. It’s a long building in rural Rhode Island of indoor and outdoor aviaries primarily occupied by macaws, conures, cockatoos, parakeets, and other parrot species who’ve been given up by their owners. 

<br><br>

The surrender rate of pet parrots is incredibly high. They’re terrible pets. They don’t see their humans as masters, they see them as partners. When someone buys a parrot expecting an accessory and ends up with a lifelong commitment, they often don’t give the birds the kind of stimulation, space, and attention they need. This can result in a parrot’s frustration, anxiety, and boredom, which can lead to screaming and self-mutilation.

<br><br> 

Part of the problem is that captive parrots aren’t  domesticated. Humans have selected and bred for the traits that differentiate dogs from wolves for for tens of thousands of years. By contrast, parrots are often only three (or fewer) generations away from their wild ancestors. They’re not docile, obedient creatures. They’re intelligent, deeply social, and emotional beings who often communicate at very high decibels. They form lifelong attachments, and experience hormonal changes and mood swings, anxiety, and depression. They have strong preferences, personalities, and long lifespans (for some species, it’s upwards of eight or nine decades!). 
<br><br>
Captivity can change a lot about how parrots develop.  I’ve heard volunteers at the sanctuary discuss how some birds don’t like other birds. They seem to identify more as human than parrot. This can change if these birds bond with another parrot. However, those who are resolutely bonded with people seemed robbed of the parrot identity. 
<br><br>
When I go to the sanctuary each week and walk through the buildings, one of the things that strikes me most is the gaze of certain parrots. This especially true of the cockatoos. As I pass by, they’ll often fly to the front of their aviaries and examine me. They’ll slowly tilt their heads and stare with their big, black eyes. They’ll watch me for minutes, barely moving. 
<br><br>
As they slowly examine me, it feels as if they’re seeing something I’m not — they’re sizing me up and studying me.  The apparent coyness and serenity of their gaze will often be punctuated by fits of crest displays, deafening shrieks, and bobbing movements, which go on for quite a while until they  stop and return to stillness. At this point, they’ll often recommence their studies. 
<br><br><br><br>
I haven’t yet developed an any kind of intuition about what’s happening inside them during their stares and storms.  They seem to be expressing aggression and anxiety and a simultaneously desire for attention. Perhaps they’re defending their territory are being triggered by something I’m doing that I’m don’t realize. Whatever may be happening, these odd, unpredictable engagements — dense with eye-contact and expressive movements— peaked my curiosity about parrots’ inner lives.
<br><br>
The emotional depth and heaviness I feel around the of the cockatoos doesn’t carry over when I’m with the conures, Senegal parrots, the macaws, or the African greys. Many of these birds also seem to have metabolized the trauma of captivity — they may pluck their own feathers or vocalize in a trans-species pidgin that combine parrot and human sounds (e.g. whistles, cackles,  “hellos). However, a greater proportion have developed relationships with other birds. Still, there are exceptions…
<br><br>
 Manny Ramirez, a lovebird who lives in a big aviary with many budgerigars and cockatiels  consistently flies onto the shoulder of anyone who enters her aviary. She’s always followed by another bird seeking her partnership. This jealous suitor bites anyone to whom Manny Ramirez gives attention. Despite these die-hard attempts, Manny Ramirez remains completely disinterested. She seems to prefer people. Similarly, while I eat lunch, Comet, a sun conure, will fly onto my shoulder and nibble gently on my neck and chest  — seeming to preen me. She too seems uninterested in birds. Pugsley is in the same boat. He’s a Quaker in an aviaries with many conures but he seems to ignore them and follow me while I clean his aviary. Sometimes he’s interested in stepping up onto my finger or flying onto my shoulder. Other times he seems more interested in biting my sneakers. While certain birds prefer people over parrots and certain people also seem prefer parrots to humans.  The sanctuary overflows with trans-species connections. 

<br><br>
The intersections of human and parrot emotion, attention, and expression that I wtiness highlights the similarities and differences between human and parrot minds and bodies. 
<br><br>
<h2>Feathers</h2>
<div id="feather"></div>
<br><br>

Parrots and humans are 300 million years apart on the evolutionary tree of life. Although they diverged from each other quite a long time ago, the radiation of birds and mammals that lead to the diversity we see today happened 65 million years ago, after the extinction of most dinosaurs. Birds are the last remaining dinosaurs. 
<br><br>
The insides and outsides of a parrots look quite distinct from those of a human. For starters, parrots have particularly colorful feathers. Their feathers contain melanins — the same class of pigments that give color to mammalian (and human) skin and hair. Much of the iridescent colors on a parrot (greens and blues) that are particularly striking derive from structural elements of the feathers themselves rather than pigments. This means that when you zoom in, certain parts of the feathers are shaped in such such a way to reflect back the wavelengths of light that we perceive and iridescence. The red and oranges parrots have are not, interestingly from carotenoid pigments — the pigments found in carrots and leaves that are revealed in the leaves of trees in the fall. While parrots do need carotenoids, which are antioxidants, in order to stay healthy, no carotenoid pigments are present in their feathers. Instead they have pigments unique to parrots, pigments which are only in their feathers and not in their blood. This means they’re not eating them. They may be manufacturing these pigments inside of their feather follicles.

<br><br>
 Although the face of a bird may not appear to be expressive, their body language and feathers can often signal a seeming endless array emotions. At the parrot sanctuary, birds will expand the small feathers on their face and chests, pump their crests up-and-down, and vibrate those on their chest to seemingly express feelings that resemble aggression, excitement, and affection.
<br><br>
While parrots are known for their vocal capacities — they have different kinds of whistles and calls and, in the wild, learn a flock dialect— they also communicate visually with body language that often involves their feathers. 
<br><br>
According to the Manual of Parrot Behavior, beak clicking is a greeting or warning, beak grinding is a signal of contentment, eye pinning: excitement, either good or bad, facial feather twitching is an expression of being startled or intrigued, fluffing is a prelude to preening or tension releasing, foot tapping is a signal of  territorial defense and tail fanning can be a courtship or aggressive display. 
<br><br>
This list seems vague and oversimplified to me. In Darwin’s Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals, he brings an evolutionary lens to understanding the homologous ways in which different animals convey emotion. He looks at similar behaviors across species (e.g. pawing mother for milk, drooping of the head, etc.) and how they’re use similar muscles and how they could be connected as expressions of similar emotional states. At the time Darwin wrote this book, physiognomy was popular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_de_Boulogne">Duchenne de Boulogne</a> explored how the stimulation of specific muscles gave rise to facial expressions of different emotions, providing an anatomical basis for expression.
<br><br>
Within mammals, the conservation of expression of emotion seems and feels much more likely because we share many of the same anatomy and musculature. But how do we begin to think of understanding and empathizing with the expression of emotion in birds? Parrots have hundreds of feathers that they are moved by surrounding muscles and tendons. They have pupils, which dilate and constrict dramatically over-and-over again when they seem to be excited. They also have expressions which involve their entire bodies (e.g. bouncing). Given that many of their expressions are far from my own, I’m not quite sure yet how I’ll begin to think about understanding the expression of emotion in parrots. However, one thing has become quite clear. They share our proclivity for anxiety and depression. 
<br><br>
<h2>Parrot Emotion </h2>
<br><br>
Parrots seem to be deeply emotional creatures. They form lifelong, monogamous bonds. In captivity, this bond may be with a human or with another bird of the same (or different) species. In captivity, the emotional energy that they may spend on taking care of their offspring and spending constant time with their mate seems to express itself in other ways.
<br><br>
Parrots raised in captivity often don’t form the social bonds key to their survival in the wild. People have written about how, like human babies, they can develop reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood, aka “failure to thrive.”
<br><br>
In captivity, as compared to on the wild, parrots do not receive the same amount of attention and partnership that they would receive from their parents and later, their mate. They don’t have a flock to call to. They don’t have a social life. Parrots who experience this often don’t know how to play or cuddle. They’re often emotionally stunted and can often develop behaviors of self mutilation.
<br><br>
Many of the parrots at the sanctuary pluck their feathers. Some cut themselves with their beaks. Despite the kind and social surroundings that the sanctuary offers, many of these parrots experienced trauma — being passed around from home to home, living in small cages. Birds in the wild do not pluck their feathers, but it’s common amongst birds in captivity. FoBordnick et al. 1994 draws the similarities between feather plucking disorder and trichotillomania, an anxiety-reducing habit analogous to finger-nail biting where people pluck out their own hair. Parrots treated for FPD are often treated with the same SSRIs or behavioral modification therapies as humans. In fact the same treatments seem to work for both.
<br><br>
But feather plucking and other compulsive behaviors that parrots develop in captivity seems to be the the tip of a very large iceberg. These birds who can live upwards of nine decades, who form life-long relationships, who have expressive vocal and bodily forms of communication seem to have deep emotional lives. 
<br><br>
<h2>Bird Bodies (Breath and Vision)</h2>
<br><br>
Parrot  morphology (except for Kakaopos) is constrained by flight.  Their bones are light (hollow with criss-crossing struts) and like most birds, they have these air sacs that fill up most of their body. Whereas our lungs are the bellows of our respiratory system, expanding and contracting with our chest muscles to inhale and exhale air, birds have rigid lungs and nine air sacs, which act as their bellows. When a bird expands their chest and breathes in, the air goes into their the big air sacs towards the bag of their body. When they contract their chest muscles and exhale, the air actually goes into their lungs. In their lungs oxygen they need gets into their blood. When they inhale again, the air from the last breath stored in their air sacs goes into their lungs, push in the now stale air in the lungs into air sacs towards the front of their body. And then, during the second exhale, the stale hair goes up the trachea and out of the nostrils. This one way-way conveyer-belt system is much more efficient than our own.
<br><br>
Parrot eyes are similar to ours except their not as spherical and their placement on a parrots head is not forward-facing like our own.
<br><br>

Parrots, and birds in general, are visual creatures like us. However, they often see much more than we do. We have different kinds of light-sensitive cells in the back of our eyeballs, in a layer called the retina. Two of the kinds of photoreceptors we have area called rods and cones. These cells convert light into electric signals,  signals our nervous system can use. Light bounces off objects and into the black hole in the middle of our eyeballs. It eventually hits retina. The rods are incredibly sensitive and can be activated by a single photon. When it’s super dark out, our rods are the cells that are helping us see. The cones, the cells that convert light wavelengths into signals that we then perceive as color in our brain — they are not as sensitive as the rods. That’s why we don’t see color at night. Cones are much less sensitive, requiring more photons to activate them. Different cones respond to different wavelengths of light. Some respond to light with short-wavelengths while others respond to medium and longer wavelengths, which we translate into different combinations of red, blue, and green. Like mixing paints, these combinations make up all the colors and shades of color that we see.
<br><br>
 None of our cones respond to really short wavelengths of light, like ultraviolet light. However, parrots, have four types of cones. The fourth cone that they have and we lack is activated by kinds of light that are outside of the visual spectrum we see. This doesn’t mean they just see one extra color that we don’t see. It means that they can make many, many more combinations of colors. They aren’t alone in having this 4D view of colors. Some fish (e.g. goldfish), insects, and mammals (e.g. reindeer) see light in the ultraviolet spectrum. 
<br><br>
What this means is that if you were staring at a rainbow with a parrot, you’d actually each see the rainbow differently. It’s similar to seeing a rainbow with someone who’s color blind — it’d be much less dramatic for them. In this analogy, we humans are colorblind. Compared to the parrot, we’re similarly colorblind, lack a cone. Humans see seven colors in the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) but a parrot would see ultraviolet, violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red and then more reds... their red cones are more sensitive than ours so they see many more reds than we do. And that’s just a rainbow. In all the objects we humans perceive as colorful, parrots often see so many more colors in those objects because they see the ultraviolet light bouncing off them. This means that parrots are seeing things about each other, and about us, that we don’t see. In a study of budgies, they covered the feathers of males that reflect ultraviolet light with sunscreen, preventing this reflection. Female budgies were not attracted to this UV-free birds.
<br><br>
Not only do parrots attract mates and signal with the color of their feathers, they also signal with the movement of their feathers. Parrots don’t have the same facial muscles we have so they don’t furrow their eyebrows or widen their eyes to express annoyance or surprise. Instead, they change the diameter of their pupil when their excited in a behavior called eye pinning, they flash their crests (the flamboyant feathers cockatoos and cockatiels have on their head)
<br><br>

<br><br>
Yet, despite our anatomical and physiological differences, it seems that parrots and people have converged in our emotional and intellectual capacities.
<br><br>
How People and Parrots Learn
<br><br>
Bird brains look very different from ours. People thought birds couldn’t possibly be intelligent for many years because the avian brain doesn’t have highly developed and convoluted neocortex like the human one does. What makes our brains brainy is that folded exterior surface called the neocortex) However, parrots do have tons of densely-packed neurons in their smoother, smaller brains and many species have exhibited feats of intelligence (e.g. tool use, complex vocal learning) that we previously attributed to only humans.

<br><br>
Although their emotional landscapes have yet to be explored, parrots’ cognitive capacities have begun to be explored, especially by Dr. Irene Pepperberg and an African grey parrot named Alex.
<br><br>
The most in-depth, long-term studies investigating parrot cognitive capacities are those of Irene Pepperberg and the African grey parrot, Alex. Alex could use language in conceptual, context-specific ways. In non-testing situations, he spontaneously demonstrated and applied ideas he’d learned in other contexts. He could count. He understood and used categories such as color and shape. 
<br><br>
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yGOgs_UlEc?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
One day, during a training session in which Alex was being tested on his understanding of number concepts,  Alex became bored and started preening. There were different shapes of different colors on a tray. Irene was asking him to tell her how many of each color object there were. He refused to answer sensibly. There were different colored objects in groups of 3, 4, and 6 on the tray and  after continuously refusing to answer a question about the number of green objects, Dr. Pepperberg posed a trick question: “What color 5?” Alex replied. He said, “None.” 
<br><br>
None?! Did Alex understand zero? Alex had learned “none” in the context of distinguishing same and different objects. However he’d never been taught to use it in reference to an absence of stuff. 
<br><br>
Like humans, it seemed that much of Alex’s learning took place in contexts where whatever he was learning was useful and meaningful. Pepperberg very explicitly thought this to be the case based on the work of epistemologists like Piaget. 
<br><br>
For Piaget (1952), all intellectual development arises from a subject’s continuous interaction with its specific environment. Development proceeds as novel experiences are assimilated into and modify pre- existing patterns, which themselves were formed during the subject’s reactions to prior experiences. A crucial factor is that the subject’s environment provides experiences that encourage such ‘‘assimilation’’ and ‘‘accommodation’’ (see, e.g., Dore ́ and Dumas 1987). Though not directly stated by Piaget, an idea inferred from his writings is that a concept or behavior is more likely to be assimilated if it has functional value for the student, particularly if this functionality is demonstrated explicitly (Wadsworth 1978; see Bandura 1971a; Merrill et al. 1996). For example, teaching the concept of color might proceed more quickly if a subject is shown that different colors represent different flavors of candy: The subject might be motivated to distinguish among differently colored candies and to learn to label red to obtain the cherry flavor, and yellow to refuse the lemon.
<br><br>

Learning requires relevance to the person or parrot who’s learning. Given this, it makes a lot of sense that Pepperberg chose a training method (the Model Rival Technique) that seems to align with how creatures as socially-motivated as parrots learn. 
<br><br>
In the Model Rival Technique, a bird watches while one human “trains” a second human. The trainer presents objects, asks questions about them, and gives praise and the objects as rewards. The human who’s being trained is a both a model and a rival for the parrot — a model of responses and a rival for rewards and attention. In Pepperberg’s work, she’d often reverse the roles of trainer and the model/rival — developing an dynamic that’s two-way. Although this Model/Rival Technique had been used before by a scientist named Todt, the parrots in those studies, although the birds did learn words, they were never able to transfer their responses to other people, except the trainer. This was obviously not the case with Alex. And it makes sense that in a dynamic social context, Alex learned how to interact. 
<br><br>
Dr. Pepperberg also paid attention to motivation. She made sure that the model/rivals and trainers made sure to act like they thought the tasks were interesting. In fact, Alex would often preen and ignore the session if the emotional content of the trainers’ suggested a lack of real relevance.  Also, Dr. Pepperberg used objects that were interesting to individuals. For instance, if an individual bird preferred corks over keys, she’d use corks in her counting experiment rather than keys.
<br><br>
And although Pepperberg’s use of the Model Rival Technique was quite successful with Alex, Alex did a lot of his learning in outside of training sessions. He learned all of the labels for different foods, despite never being explicitly trained to say them. Similarly, when he no longer ate certain foods, he stopped using the words for them.  
<br><br>
“He stopped producing ‘‘braa’’ and ‘‘graed’’ [the sounds he used for bread] about the same time he stopped eating bread, but he continued to eat green beans and to practice sounds related to that label; he also later produced clear renditions of ‘‘bread’’ when we introduced muffins. Reexamination of monologues for emotional content might provide additional insights on use and frequency (note Dore 1989)” (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>

Before Alex, people didn’t think birds or parrots were intelligent. Several scientists in the 1950s tried for years to train parrots to speak. They primarily used operant conditioning — making the parrots depndent on the trainers for food, water, and social attention. They’d only get food, water, and social attention when they said the words and sounds the trainers said and wanted them to say (e.g. “Hello”).						<br><br>				
The idea was that, after a bird emitted vocalizations with some frequency, it could be trained to produce the utterance only in the original, appropriate context (on the appearance of the trainer) by providing the food only when the vocalization was emitted in such a situation.
<br><br>						
Mowrer’s birds acquired few vocalizations. His use of food rewards that directly related neither to the task being taught nor the skill being targeted (such as saying ‘‘Hello’’ when the trainer appeared) probably delayed or possibly prevented learning: Most likely, birds confounded the label of the object or action to be taught with that of the unrelated food reward (Pepperberg 1978, 1981; see Bruner 1978; Greenfield 1978; Miles 1983). That is, his birds apparently connected reproduc- tion of human sounds with the inevitable appearance of food (a salient object to a hungry bird) rather than with their actual referents, for example, ‘‘Hello’’ and the appearance of the trainer. Birds clearly did not realize that a trainer’s appearance was the relevant stimulus for producing ‘‘Hello.’’ Attempts to obtain food by producing ‘‘Hello’’ when a trainer was already in place would eventually fail: The trainer would consider that the vocalization had been used inappropriately and provide no reward; a bird’s production of the strange sound (‘‘Hello’’) would consequently lessen (in behaviorist terms, ‘‘be extinguished’’). Moreover, because a bird received food for whatever it pro- duced, it may have stopped learning after acquiring one or two utterances that were sufficient for decreasing its hunger.
<br><br>						
[...]The puzzling aspect of these failures was why these birds, which were so vocal in the wild and which learned allospecific vocalizations so readily in the informal setting of a home (Amsler 1947; Boosey 1947; Hensley 1980), were incapable of significant vocal learning under well-controlled laboratory conditions. (Pepperberg, 1999)

<br><br>
After these studies, people concluded that parrots couldn’t learn language.
<br><br>
The failure of these experiments remind me of the failure of School. In his book, How Children Fail, John Holt describes his worst student and how his behavior in school was nothing like his behavior outside of school and yet, he was considered to be severely damaged. 
<br><br>
					
“The worst student we had, the worst I have ever encountered, was in his life outside the classroom as mature, intelligent, and interesting a person as anyone at the school. What went wrong? Experts muttered to his parents about brain damage—a handy way to end a mystery that you can't explain otherwise. Somewhere along the line, his intelligence became disconnected from his schooling. Where? Why?” (How Students Fail, 1964)
<br><br>				
The problem with this young person is not rooted in him...the problem seems to be that the very structure of School doesn’t take into account how people really learn. Real learning and communication is..real. It’s contextual. It’s meaningful and relevant for the learner.  The reason for learning makes sense for the organism doing it. Whatever activity being done is hard and is often in a social context that’s pushing the learning organism beyond their comfort zone. This is not the case in environments that use operant conditioning, and it’s not the case in School. However, it’s often the case outside of school. 

<br><br>
Over time, Dr. Pepperberg learned (and then studied) how Alex’s language learned crystallized in non-training contexts where there were fewer consequences and in other informal (non-training) where he was authentically motivated.
<br><br>
In a similar way to how children learning a language practice. Babies babble alone in their cribs, as do  immature, isolated birds laboratories and in the wild. Parrots do something similar, (Pepperberg refers to them as “monologues”) when their alone. Dr. Pepperberg was interested in the degree to parrots actively practiced his communication code in the absence of social stimulation. Epistemologists like Piaget and Vygotsky thought such practice was integral to development and “facilitates learning by allowing immature individuals to experiment with the adult system without experiences the consequences of failure.” (Pepperberg, 1996) since it occurs in many species, there could be an evolutionary basis for language play. 
<br><br>
It turns out that Alex really did practice his language. Before he could clearly say “none” and before he said it the first time, it was documented that he had practiced it his monologues. 
<br><br>
However, the most striking thing to me about were that that they seemed to be, in part, socially motivated. “Although Alex’s monologue speech increased 30.8% overall during training on ‘‘none,’’ which necessarily increased caretaker input, his increase in utterances per night also coincided with students’ return from summer vacation. Their return meant more people in the lab and a greater variety of tasks, and could have provided stimulation equal to that he received in training.” (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>
In an experiment where budgies were taught different whistles in response to a red and a green light, they performed very well. From this, the authors deduced that the birds understood the concept of colors. However, this experiment actually only shows that the birds associated different whistles with different lights. If the birds used their same whistles when shown many different green or red objects, that would show that they had an understanding of the idea of color. In this case, they’d be applying and using category of color. What’s relevant to the bird is the food. What they seem to be learning is how to whistle in response to different stimuli in order to get food. The task is totally disconnected from the reward. Alex’s rewards were the objects themselves (they often chose to ask him about objects he liked chewing on). In that context, the reward of the object aligns with the task of saying the label for the object.
<br><br>
“Learning” in school is similarly disconnected from meaning, usefulness, and the abstract rewards students are given (i.e. grades). Here’s a video of Harvard Graduates trying to explain the seasons, and failing most of the time. This isn’t interesting to me because it’s a “gotcha” of Harvard students. Rather, it’s interesting because it shows how disconnected School is. These folks obviously know that it gets cold in the winter and warm in the summer. They know, in some abstract way that the earth spins around the sun. I’m sure they also know that regions along the equator do not have seasons in the same ways and that their explanations imply that half of the world’s equator regions should have seasons. But they’re not actually thinking about what they’re doing. They’re trained to say the right answer and what they learned in school was — within itself — disconnected and disconnect from the world.

Alex could have become a good student rather than someone who actually understood what he was being asked about. However, Pepperberg was not interested in “Schooling” Alex and teaching him confusing, disconnected associations. Instead, she created a context that, the the extent possible, made Alex’s experience authentic enough so that she could actually see what he understood.
<br><br>
Pepperberg derived her learning principles for Alex’s training based on Piaget and Vygotsky. Her optimal learning experiences for Alex:
Correlated well with specific aspects of an individual’s environment (be ‘‘referential’’) 
Have functional meaning relevant to the individual’s environment (also known as ‘‘contextual applicability’’)
 Were socially interactive. (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>
To avoid a situation like Hans the Clever Horse, and the teacher-face-reading that often happens in classrooms, Pepperberg makes sure that she and her students were not cuing the animals. This often means that students would ask questions of the birds about objects they did not know the specific names of (since a lot of the words Alex learned for objects were idiosyncratic  (e.g. clothes pin was “peg wood”). 
<br><br>
In Holt’s book he describes strategies young people learn in order to avoid the consequences of failing in school. This is a path many animals take in training contexts where the people training them are not careful about it….
<br><br>
Here are some specific strategies Holt describes:
<br><br>
“The mumble strategy is particularly effective in language classes. In my French classes, the students used to work it on me, without my knowing what was going on. It is particularly effective with a teacher who is finicky about accents and proud of his own. To get such a teacher to answer his own questions is a cinch. Just make some mumbled, garbled, hideously un- French answer, and the teacher, with a shudder, will give the correct answer in elegant French. The student will have to repeat it after him, but by that time, he is out of the worst danger.” (Holt, 1964)
<br><br>
“There was a good deal of the tried-and-true strategy of guess-and-look, in which you start to say a word, all the while scrutinizing the teacher's face to see whether you are on the right track or not. With most teachers, no further strategies are needed. This one was more poker-faced than most, so guess- and-look wasn't working very well. Still, the percentage of hits was remarkably high, especially since it was clear to me from the way the children were talking and acting that they hadn't a notion of what nouns, adjectives, and verbs were. Finally one child said, "Miss —, you shouldn't point to the answer each time." The teacher was surprised, and asked what she meant. The child said, "Well, you don't exactly point, but you kind of stand next to the answer." This was no clearer, since the teacher had been standing still. But after a while, as the class went on, I thought I saw what the girl meant. Since the teacher wrote each word down in its proper column, she was, in a way, getting herself ready to write, pointing herself at the place where she would soon be writing. From the angle of her body to the blackboard the children picked up a subtle clue to the correct answer.” (Holt, 1964)

<br><br>
I wonder what kind of strategies like these animals all over the world in laboratories are deploying on their unsuspecting observers.
<br><br>
Irene Pepperberg’s work with Alex and her book The Alex Studies, has been more useful than many contemporary book I’ve read on education about what learning is… because in trying converse with another species and in order to make sure that her work was scientific and accurate,  she really had to figure out what good learning looked like and had to make her principles and her methods quite explicit.
<br><br>
I’ve never previously considered the way in which looking at animal learning could help to make my own ideas about learning more explicit, but it wouldn’t be so surprising if the epistemological phenomena that Piaget studied were true across species with an evolutionary basis.
