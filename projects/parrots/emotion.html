	<title>Parrot Emotion</title>

<h2>Parrot Emotion </h2>
    <br>
    <br> 

    <p>Parrots seem to be deeply emotional creatures. They form lifelong, monogamous bonds. In captivity, this bond may be with a human or with another bird of the same (or different) species. In captivity, the emotional energy that they may spend on taking care of their offspring and spending constant time with their mate seems to express itself in other ways.
    <br>
    <br> Parrots raised in captivity often don’t form the social bonds key to their survival in the wild. People have written about how, like human babies, they can develop reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood, aka “failure to thrive.”
    <br>
    <br> In captivity, as compared to on the wild, parrots do not receive the same amount of attention and partnership that they would receive from their parents and later, their mate. They don’t have a flock to call to. They don’t have a social life. Parrots who experience this often don’t know how to play or cuddle. They’re often emotionally stunted and can often develop behaviors of self mutilation.
    <br>
    <br> Many of the parrots at the sanctuary pluck their feathers. Some cut themselves with their beaks. Despite the kind and social surroundings that the sanctuary offers, many of these parrots experienced trauma — being passed around from home to home, living in small cages. Birds in the wild do not pluck their feathers, but it’s common amongst birds in captivity. FoBordnick et al. 1994 draws the similarities between feather plucking disorder and trichotillomania, an anxiety-reducing habit analogous to finger-nail biting where people pluck out their own hair. Parrots treated for FPD are often treated with the same SSRIs or behavioral modification therapies as humans. In fact the same treatments seem to work for both.
    <br>
    <br> But feather plucking and other compulsive behaviors that parrots develop in captivity seems to be the the tip of a very large iceberg. These birds who can live upwards of nine decades, who form life-long relationships, who have expressive vocal and bodily forms of communication seem to have deep emotional lives.
