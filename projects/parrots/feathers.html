<h2>Feathers</h2>

<div id="feather"></div>

<p>
    Parrots and humans are 300 million years apart on the evolutionary tree of life. Although they diverged from each other quite a long time ago, the radiation of birds and mammals that lead to the diversity we see today happened 65 million years ago, after the extinction of most dinosaurs. Birds are the last remaining dinosaurs.
    <br>
    <br> The insides and outsides of a parrots look quite distinct from those of a human. For starters, parrots have particularly colorful feathers. Their feathers contain melanins — the same class of pigments that give color to mammalian (and human) skin and hair. Much of the iridescent colors on a parrot (greens and blues) that are particularly striking derive from structural elements of the feathers themselves rather than pigments. This means that when you zoom in, certain parts of the feathers are shaped in such such a way to reflect back the wavelengths of light that we perceive and iridescence. The red and oranges parrots have are not, interestingly from carotenoid pigments — the pigments found in carrots and leaves that are revealed in the leaves of trees in the fall. While parrots do need carotenoids, which are antioxidants, in order to stay healthy, no carotenoid pigments are present in their feathers. Instead they have pigments unique to parrots, pigments which are only in their feathers and not in their blood. This means they’re not eating them. They may be manufacturing these pigments inside of their feather follicles.
    <br>
    <br> Although the face of a bird may not appear to be expressive, their body language and feathers can often signal a seeming endless array emotions. At the parrot sanctuary, birds will expand the small feathers on their face and chests, pump their crests up-and-down, and vibrate those on their chest to seemingly express feelings that resemble aggression, excitement, and affection.
    <br>
    <br> While parrots are known for their vocal capacities — they have different kinds of whistles and calls and, in the wild, learn a flock dialect— they also communicate visually with body language that often involves their feathers.
    <br>
    <br> According to the Manual of Parrot Behavior, beak clicking is a greeting or warning, beak grinding is a signal of contentment, eye pinning: excitement, either good or bad, facial feather twitching is an expression of being startled or intrigued, fluffing is a prelude to preening or tension releasing, foot tapping is a signal of territorial defense and tail fanning can be a courtship or aggressive display.
    <br>
    <br> This list seems vague and oversimplified to me. In Darwin’s Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals, he brings an evolutionary lens to understanding the homologous ways in which different animals convey emotion. He looks at similar behaviors across species (e.g. pawing mother for milk, drooping of the head, etc.) and how they’re use similar muscles and how they could be connected as expressions of similar emotional states. At the time Darwin wrote this book, physiognomy was popular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_de_Boulogne">Duchenne de Boulogne</a> explored how the stimulation of specific muscles gave rise to facial expressions of different emotions, providing an anatomical basis for expression.
    <br>
    <br> Within mammals, the conservation of expression of emotion seems and feels much more likely because we share many of the same anatomy and musculature. But how do we begin to think of understanding and empathizing with the expression of emotion in birds? Parrots have hundreds of feathers that they are moved by surrounding muscles and tendons. They have pupils, which dilate and constrict dramatically over-and-over again when they seem to be excited. They also have expressions which involve their entire bodies (e.g. bouncing). Given that many of their expressions are far from my own, I’m not quite sure yet how I’ll begin to think about understanding the expression of emotion in parrots. However, one thing has become quite clear. They share our proclivity for anxiety and depression.
