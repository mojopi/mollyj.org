<h2>Thinking About How People and Parrots Learn</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Bird brains look very different from ours. People thought birds couldn’t possibly be intelligent for many years because the avian brain doesn’t have highly developed and convoluted neocortex like the human one does. What makes our brains brainy is that folded exterior surface called the neocortex) However, parrots do have tons of densely-packed neurons in their smoother, smaller brains and many species have exhibited feats of intelligence (e.g. tool use, complex vocal learning) that we previously attributed to only humans.

<br><br>
Although their emotional landscapes have yet to be explored, parrots’ cognitive capacities have begun to be explored, especially by Dr. Irene Pepperberg and an African grey parrot named Alex.
<br><br>
The most in-depth, long-term studies investigating parrot cognitive capacities are those of Irene Pepperberg and the African grey parrot, Alex. Alex could use language in conceptual, context-specific ways. In non-testing situations, he spontaneously demonstrated and applied ideas he’d learned in other contexts. He could count. He understood and used categories such as color and shape. 
<br><br>
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yGOgs_UlEc?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
One day, during a training session in which Alex was being tested on his understanding of number concepts,  Alex became bored and started preening. There were different shapes of different colors on a tray. Irene was asking him to tell her how many of each color object there were. He refused to answer sensibly. There were different colored objects in groups of 3, 4, and 6 on the tray and  after continuously refusing to answer a question about the number of green objects, Dr. Pepperberg posed a trick question: “What color 5?” Alex replied. He said, “None.” 
<br><br>
None?! Did Alex understand zero? Alex had learned “none” in the context of distinguishing same and different objects. However he’d never been taught to use it in reference to an absence of stuff. 
<br><br>
Like humans, it seemed that much of Alex’s learning took place in contexts where whatever he was learning was useful and meaningful. Pepperberg very explicitly thought this to be the case based on the work of epistemologists like Piaget. 
<br><br>
For Piaget (1952), all intellectual development arises from a subject’s continuous interaction with its specific environment. Development proceeds as novel experiences are assimilated into and modify pre- existing patterns, which themselves were formed during the subject’s reactions to prior experiences. A crucial factor is that the subject’s environment provides experiences that encourage such ‘‘assimilation’’ and ‘‘accommodation’’ (see, e.g., Dore ́ and Dumas 1987). Though not directly stated by Piaget, an idea inferred from his writings is that a concept or behavior is more likely to be assimilated if it has functional value for the student, particularly if this functionality is demonstrated explicitly (Wadsworth 1978; see Bandura 1971a; Merrill et al. 1996). For example, teaching the concept of color might proceed more quickly if a subject is shown that different colors represent different flavors of candy: The subject might be motivated to distinguish among differently colored candies and to learn to label red to obtain the cherry flavor, and yellow to refuse the lemon.
<br><br>

Learning requires relevance to the person or parrot who’s learning. Given this, it makes a lot of sense that Pepperberg chose a training method (the Model Rival Technique) that seems to align with how creatures as socially-motivated as parrots learn. 
<br><br>
In the Model Rival Technique, a bird watches while one human “trains” a second human. The trainer presents objects, asks questions about them, and gives praise and the objects as rewards. The human who’s being trained is a both a model and a rival for the parrot — a model of responses and a rival for rewards and attention. In Pepperberg’s work, she’d often reverse the roles of trainer and the model/rival — developing an dynamic that’s two-way. Although this Model/Rival Technique had been used before by a scientist named Todt, the parrots in those studies, although the birds did learn words, they were never able to transfer their responses to other people, except the trainer. This was obviously not the case with Alex. And it makes sense that in a dynamic social context, Alex learned how to interact. 
<br><br>
Dr. Pepperberg also paid attention to motivation. She made sure that the model/rivals and trainers made sure to act like they thought the tasks were interesting. In fact, Alex would often preen and ignore the session if the emotional content of the trainers’ suggested a lack of real relevance.  Also, Dr. Pepperberg used objects that were interesting to individuals. For instance, if an individual bird preferred corks over keys, she’d use corks in her counting experiment rather than keys.
<br><br>
And although Pepperberg’s use of the Model Rival Technique was quite successful with Alex, Alex did a lot of his learning in outside of training sessions. He learned all of the labels for different foods, despite never being explicitly trained to say them. Similarly, when he no longer ate certain foods, he stopped using the words for them.  
<br><br>
“He stopped producing ‘‘braa’’ and ‘‘graed’’ [the sounds he used for bread] about the same time he stopped eating bread, but he continued to eat green beans and to practice sounds related to that label; he also later produced clear renditions of ‘‘bread’’ when we introduced muffins. Reexamination of monologues for emotional content might provide additional insights on use and frequency (note Dore 1989)” (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>

Before Alex, people didn’t think birds or parrots were intelligent. Several scientists in the 1950s tried for years to train parrots to speak. They primarily used operant conditioning — making the parrots depndent on the trainers for food, water, and social attention. They’d only get food, water, and social attention when they said the words and sounds the trainers said and wanted them to say (e.g. “Hello”).						<br><br>				
The idea was that, after a bird emitted vocalizations with some frequency, it could be trained to produce the utterance only in the original, appropriate context (on the appearance of the trainer) by providing the food only when the vocalization was emitted in such a situation.
<br><br>						
Mowrer’s birds acquired few vocalizations. His use of food rewards that directly related neither to the task being taught nor the skill being targeted (such as saying ‘‘Hello’’ when the trainer appeared) probably delayed or possibly prevented learning: Most likely, birds confounded the label of the object or action to be taught with that of the unrelated food reward (Pepperberg 1978, 1981; see Bruner 1978; Greenfield 1978; Miles 1983). That is, his birds apparently connected reproduc- tion of human sounds with the inevitable appearance of food (a salient object to a hungry bird) rather than with their actual referents, for example, ‘‘Hello’’ and the appearance of the trainer. Birds clearly did not realize that a trainer’s appearance was the relevant stimulus for producing ‘‘Hello.’’ Attempts to obtain food by producing ‘‘Hello’’ when a trainer was already in place would eventually fail: The trainer would consider that the vocalization had been used inappropriately and provide no reward; a bird’s production of the strange sound (‘‘Hello’’) would consequently lessen (in behaviorist terms, ‘‘be extinguished’’). Moreover, because a bird received food for whatever it pro- duced, it may have stopped learning after acquiring one or two utterances that were sufficient for decreasing its hunger.
<br><br>						
[...]The puzzling aspect of these failures was why these birds, which were so vocal in the wild and which learned allospecific vocalizations so readily in the informal setting of a home (Amsler 1947; Boosey 1947; Hensley 1980), were incapable of significant vocal learning under well-controlled laboratory conditions. (Pepperberg, 1999)

<br><br>
After these studies, people concluded that parrots couldn’t learn language.
<br><br>
The failure of these experiments remind me of the failure of School. In his book, How Children Fail, John Holt describes his worst student and how his behavior in school was nothing like his behavior outside of school and yet, he was considered to be severely damaged. 
<br><br>
					
“The worst student we had, the worst I have ever encountered, was in his life outside the classroom as mature, intelligent, and interesting a person as anyone at the school. What went wrong? Experts muttered to his parents about brain damage—a handy way to end a mystery that you can't explain otherwise. Somewhere along the line, his intelligence became disconnected from his schooling. Where? Why?” (How Students Fail, 1964)
<br><br>				
The problem with this young person is not rooted in him...the problem seems to be that the very structure of School doesn’t take into account how people really learn. Real learning and communication is..real. It’s contextual. It’s meaningful and relevant for the learner.  The reason for learning makes sense for the organism doing it. Whatever activity being done is hard and is often in a social context that’s pushing the learning organism beyond their comfort zone. This is not the case in environments that use operant conditioning, and it’s not the case in School. However, it’s often the case outside of school. 

<br><br>
Over time, Dr. Pepperberg learned (and then studied) how Alex’s language learned crystallized in non-training contexts where there were fewer consequences and in other informal (non-training) where he was authentically motivated.
<br><br>
In a similar way to how children learning a language practice. Babies babble alone in their cribs, as do  immature, isolated birds laboratories and in the wild. Parrots do something similar, (Pepperberg refers to them as “monologues”) when their alone. Dr. Pepperberg was interested in the degree to parrots actively practiced his communication code in the absence of social stimulation. Epistemologists like Piaget and Vygotsky thought such practice was integral to development and “facilitates learning by allowing immature individuals to experiment with the adult system without experiences the consequences of failure.” (Pepperberg, 1996) since it occurs in many species, there could be an evolutionary basis for language play. 
<br><br>
It turns out that Alex really did practice his language. Before he could clearly say “none” and before he said it the first time, it was documented that he had practiced it his monologues. 
<br><br>
However, the most striking thing to me about were that that they seemed to be, in part, socially motivated. “Although Alex’s monologue speech increased 30.8% overall during training on ‘‘none,’’ which necessarily increased caretaker input, his increase in utterances per night also coincided with students’ return from summer vacation. Their return meant more people in the lab and a greater variety of tasks, and could have provided stimulation equal to that he received in training.” (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>
In an experiment where budgies were taught different whistles in response to a red and a green light, they performed very well. From this, the authors deduced that the birds understood the concept of colors. However, this experiment actually only shows that the birds associated different whistles with different lights. If the birds used their same whistles when shown many different green or red objects, that would show that they had an understanding of the idea of color. In this case, they’d be applying and using category of color. What’s relevant to the bird is the food. What they seem to be learning is how to whistle in response to different stimuli in order to get food. The task is totally disconnected from the reward. Alex’s rewards were the objects themselves (they often chose to ask him about objects he liked chewing on). In that context, the reward of the object aligns with the task of saying the label for the object.
<br><br>
“Learning” in school is similarly disconnected from meaning, usefulness, and the abstract rewards students are given (i.e. grades). Here’s a video of Harvard Graduates trying to explain the seasons, and failing most of the time. This isn’t interesting to me because it’s a “gotcha” of Harvard students. Rather, it’s interesting because it shows how disconnected School is. These folks obviously know that it gets cold in the winter and warm in the summer. They know, in some abstract way that the earth spins around the sun. I’m sure they also know that regions along the equator do not have seasons in the same ways and that their explanations imply that half of the world’s equator regions should have seasons. But they’re not actually thinking about what they’re doing. They’re trained to say the right answer and what they learned in school was — within itself — disconnected and disconnect from the world.

<br><br>
Alex could have become a good student rather than someone who actually understood what he was being asked about. However, Pepperberg was not interested in “Schooling” Alex and teaching him confusing, disconnected associations. Instead, she created a context that, the the extent possible, made Alex’s experience authentic enough so that she could actually see what he understood.
<br><br>
Pepperberg derived her learning principles for Alex’s training based on Piaget and Vygotsky. Her optimal learning experiences for Alex:
Correlated well with specific aspects of an individual’s environment (be ‘‘referential’’) 
Have functional meaning relevant to the individual’s environment (also known as ‘‘contextual applicability’’)
 Were socially interactive. (Pepperberg, 1999)
<br><br>
To avoid a situation like Hans the Clever Horse, and the teacher-face-reading that often happens in classrooms, Pepperberg makes sure that she and her students were not cuing the animals. This often means that students would ask questions of the birds about objects they did not know the specific names of (since a lot of the words Alex learned for objects were idiosyncratic  (e.g. clothes pin was “peg wood”). 
<br><br>
In Holt’s book he describes strategies young people learn in order to avoid the consequences of failing in school. This is a path many animals take in training contexts where the people training them are not careful about it….
<br><br>
Here are some specific strategies Holt describes:
<br><br>
“The mumble strategy is particularly effective in language classes. In my French classes, the students used to work it on me, without my knowing what was going on. It is particularly effective with a teacher who is finicky about accents and proud of his own. To get such a teacher to answer his own questions is a cinch. Just make some mumbled, garbled, hideously un- French answer, and the teacher, with a shudder, will give the correct answer in elegant French. The student will have to repeat it after him, but by that time, he is out of the worst danger.” (Holt, 1964)
<br><br>
“There was a good deal of the tried-and-true strategy of guess-and-look, in which you start to say a word, all the while scrutinizing the teacher's face to see whether you are on the right track or not. With most teachers, no further strategies are needed. This one was more poker-faced than most, so guess- and-look wasn't working very well. Still, the percentage of hits was remarkably high, especially since it was clear to me from the way the children were talking and acting that they hadn't a notion of what nouns, adjectives, and verbs were. Finally one child said, "Miss —, you shouldn't point to the answer each time." The teacher was surprised, and asked what she meant. The child said, "Well, you don't exactly point, but you kind of stand next to the answer." This was no clearer, since the teacher had been standing still. But after a while, as the class went on, I thought I saw what the girl meant. Since the teacher wrote each word down in its proper column, she was, in a way, getting herself ready to write, pointing herself at the place where she would soon be writing. From the angle of her body to the blackboard the children picked up a subtle clue to the correct answer.” (Holt, 1964)

<br><br>
I wonder what kind of strategies like these animals all over the world in laboratories are deploying on their unsuspecting observers.
<br><br>
Irene Pepperberg’s work with Alex and her book The Alex Studies, has been more useful than many contemporary book I’ve read on education about what learning is… because in trying converse with another species and in order to make sure that her work was scientific and accurate,  she really had to figure out what good learning looked like and had to make her principles and her methods quite explicit.
<br><br>
I’ve never previously considered the way in which looking at animal learning could help to make my own ideas about learning more explicit, but it wouldn’t be so surprising if the epistemological phenomena that Piaget studied were true across species with an evolutionary basis.
