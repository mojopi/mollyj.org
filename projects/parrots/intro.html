<h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve never thought of myself as a “bird person.” Historically, I’ve been more of a marine mammal fan. Dolphins and whales have been my obsession since childhood. They’re simultaneously alien and human. Their vocalizations, signature whistles, enjoyment of physical contact, social lifestyle, tool use, parental care, echolocation, voluntary breathing — it’s a mosaic of qualities and ways of being which feel simultaneously familiar and foreign. When I look at them and they look back at me, I get this feeling of mutual engagement: it feels like they’re <i>really</i> looking.
        <br>
        <br> Similar experiences of communion are often described with apes, elephants, and octopuses. I want to have this experience with parrots. In observing and getting to know several parrots, I hope to develop questions about how parrots operate and to develop a better sense of how they experience the world.
        <br>
        <br> The sanctuary where I volunteer, Foster Parrots, consists of indoor and outdoor aviaries primarily occupied by macaws, conures, cockatoos, parakeets, and other parrot species who’ve been given up by their owners.
        <br>
        <br> The surrender rate of pet parrots is incredibly high. They’re terrible pets. They don’t see their humans as masters, they see them as partners. When someone buys a parrot expecting an accessory and ends up with a lifelong commitment, they often don’t give the birds the kind of stimulation, space, and attention they need. This can result in a parrot’s frustration, anxiety, and boredom, which can lead to screaming and self-mutilation.
        <br>
        <br> Part of the problem is that captive parrots aren’t domesticated. Humans have selected and bred for the traits that differentiate dogs from wolves for for tens of thousands of years. By contrast, parrots are often only three (or fewer) generations away from their wild ancestors. They’re not docile, obedient creatures. They’re intelligent, deeply social, and emotional beings who often communicate at very high decibels. They form lifelong attachments, and experience hormonal changes and mood swings, anxiety, and depression. They have strong preferences, personalities, and long lifespans (for some species, it’s upwards of eight or nine decades!).
        <br>
        <br> Captivity can change a lot about how parrots develop. I’ve heard volunteers at the sanctuary discuss how some birds don’t like other birds. They seem to identify more as human than parrot. This can change if these birds bond with another parrot. However, those who are resolutely bonded with people seemed robbed of the parrot identity.
        <br>
        <br> When I go to the sanctuary each week and walk through the buildings, one of the things that strikes me most is the gaze of certain parrots. This is especially true of the cockatoos. As I pass by, they’ll often fly to the front of their aviaries and examine me. They’ll slowly tilt their heads and stare with their big, black eyes. They’ll watch me for minutes, barely moving.
        <br>
        <br> As they slowly examine me, it feels as if they’re seeing something I’m not — they’re sizing me up and studying me. The apparent coyness and serenity of their gaze will often be punctuated by fits of crest displays, deafening shrieks, and bobbing movements, which go on for quite a while until they stop and return to stillness. At this point, they’ll often recommence their studies.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I haven’t yet developed an any kind of intuition about what’s happening inside them during their stares and storms. They seem to be expressing aggression and anxiety and a simultaneously desire for attention. Perhaps they’re defending their territory are being triggered by something I’m doing that I’m don’t realize. Whatever may be happening, these odd, unpredictable engagements — dense with eye-contact and expressive movements— peaked my curiosity about parrots’ inner lives.
        <br>
        <br> The emotional depth and heaviness I feel around the of the cockatoos doesn’t carry over when I’m with the conures, Senegal parrots, the macaws, or the African greys. Many of these birds also seem to have metabolized the trauma of captivity — they may pluck their own feathers or vocalize in a trans-species pidgin that combine parrot and human sounds (e.g. whistles, cackles, “hellos). However, a greater proportion have developed relationships with other birds. Still, there are exceptions…
        <br>
        <br> Manny Ramirez, a lovebird who lives in a big aviary with many budgerigars and cockatiels consistently flies onto the shoulder of anyone who enters her aviary. She’s always followed by another bird seeking her partnership. This jealous suitor bites anyone to whom Manny Ramirez gives attention. Despite these die-hard attempts, Manny Ramirez remains completely disinterested. She seems to prefer people. Similarly, while I eat lunch, Comet, a sun conure, will fly onto my shoulder and nibble gently on my neck and chest — seeming to preen me. She too seems uninterested in birds. Pugsley is in the same boat. He’s a Quaker in an aviaries with many conures but he seems to ignore them and follow me while I clean his aviary. Sometimes he’s interested in stepping up onto my finger or flying onto my shoulder. Other times he seems more interested in biting my sneakers. While certain birds prefer people over parrots and certain people also seem prefer parrots to humans. The sanctuary overflows with trans-species connections.
        <br>
        <br> The intersections of human and parrot emotion, attention, and expression that I wtiness highlights the similarities and differences between human and parrot minds and bodies.
