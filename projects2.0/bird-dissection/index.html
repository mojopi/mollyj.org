                Several weeks ago I looked into the insides of a beautiful thrush who my friend had found dead in the street. This was so different from any dissection I'd done in the past. We were really trying to <i>see</i> the body of this thrush with fresh eyes. We were trying to notice the details and ask our own questions. We weren't trying to match a manual or a textbook and, as a result, we saw a lot.
                <br>
                <br> We saw things we didn't yet have words for, and this meant that the seeing came before the language, resulting in particularly wonder-full moments discovery bubbling up.
                <br>
                <br> We saw different type of feathers, we saw elastic skin that seemed to help the thrush flap it's wings, we saw rings around it's wind pipe, black textured insides of it's stomach, shimmering lungs, and whiskers around it's beak. We also saw things that we had previously "learned" but not <i>really</i>known before. We discovered the proportions of its leg bones, their thinness, its tiny hip socket, its large heart, and how its muscles threaded from its chest to the top of its wings.
                <br>
                <br> Here's some of what we <i>saw</i> the day we looked inside a beautiful thrush. It was quite an intimate and sacred activity to look inside another being.

            Around the beak, this thrush had what I would describe as… <i>whiskers</i>.
            <br>
            <br> I had never known that these structures existed in some bird species. I associate whiskers (aka vibrissae) solely with mammals — cats, dogs, manatees — not feathered creatures.
            <br>
            <br> However, it turns out that these hair-like feathers, rictal bristles, are often thought of as being similar to whiskers. However, like whiskers, it's not <i>totally</i> clear what they do or how they work.
            <br>
            <br> People have thought that they're used to help birds capture flying insect prey (acting likea net) when they themselves are hunting and flying. However, experiemnts where rictal bristles have been cut off or taped down seem to show that this doesn't affect a bird's hunting ability. Some still speculate that they're used to detect airflow around the head and can help birds detect insects in that way.
            <br>
            <br>Another hypothesis is that they protect a hunting-birds eyes form stinging prey parts or other debris that may come flying towards their face while they're hunting. Experiments have been done where dead birds with sticky stuff over their eyes have been put in wind tunnels with stuff flying towards their faces. Bird bodies with rictal bristles seem to have less stuff go in their eyes. So maybe that's part of their function.
            <br>
            <br>Or, maybe they help birds get around in the dark. Experiments where birds were put in mazes in the dark showed that they did much better navigating the mazes when their rictal bristles were fully in tact. So are rictal bristles more like eyelashes or more like whiskers?
            <br>
            <br> Whiskers are sensory structures that have have significant brain real-estate dedicated to sensory information they generate. It seems that the whiskers act as an array to communicate sensory information to their owners. They're actively moved by muscles and used to sense the world through coordinated "whisking" actions.
            <br>
            <br> Whiskers are a relatively new sensory system in the mammal lineage. We know this because monotremes (platypi and echidnas), which branched from the other groups of mammals a long time ago, don't have whiskers. In marsupial and placental (non-marsupial) mammal lineages, the way in which whiskers are arranged is relatively conserved.
            <br>
            <br> In cats, these coarser modified hairs reside on the face (above the eye, the mustache region, and even on the back of their front legs!). Mice and rats also have most of their whiskers in the mustache region. Manatees are quite different — all of the hairs on their bodies are vibrissae — follicles with mechanoreceptors that are intensely innervated, with an extensive surrounding blood supply.
            <br>
            <br> Rictal bristles are, like whiskers, surrounded mechanoreceptors called herbst corpuscles. Herbst corpuscules are collections of connective-tissue cells surrounding the end of a nerve cell. The connective tissue cells around the nerve-ending core are layered like an onion. When pressed, they deform and eventually press on a nerve ending, which passes information to the trigeminal nerve (a nerve we also have in our face), and eventually to the brain.
            <br>
            <br> Next… I'm going to look into herbst corpuscules and how these little onion-receptors in bird beaks and near rictal bristles work.
