            In college and while teaching high school biology, I dissected animals â€” hagfish, squid, sharks, and fetal pigs, and cow eyes. Their bodies arrived in the mail from the Carolina scientific supply company.

            Where did these animals come from? Did this company raise these animals? Did they capture them in the wild? I was too scared to answer the questions that loomed in my mind but the ways in which these bodies had been and were being objectified made it easier to dispell my concerns. I forced myself to see these animals as diagrams, not as whole beings, and I'm not proud of that.

        The Carolina Scientific Supply Company made it easy to forget that these were animals. They came in kits with shiny pamphlets and buyouant descriptions of what you'd see once you looked inside these animals. Their bodies had been rubbarized in preservatives and then wrapped in plastic. They arrived soaking and smelling something like vinegar. Some animals' blood vessels had been dyed so we could recognize their different arteries and veins.Their bodies had been transformed to match the clean cartoons in our textbooks.
