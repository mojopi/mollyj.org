Or is it just not the right frame to push right now? What do I do about this?

				<h4 style="font-size:2rem; line-height:4rem;"> (I’ve been spending a lot of time generating stuff around the animal’s I’m observing but haven’t done a great job of taking enough time to "just" observe them. The construction of  materails does help me see and think and is motivating, but I want to make sure I'm getting better at <i>observing.</i>)</h4>

My work with snails is <i>just</i> starting to feel like "seeing with own eyes" (e.g. content of snail portrait vs. journal, Clover's race idea, shell generator idea). How do I get to this place sooner without going through the "book report" phase? </h4>
