    <p><a href="https://www.seedsofpeace.org/">Seeds of Peace</a> (SOP) is a camp in Maine that brings together young people and adults from regions of conflict â€” the Middle East (e.g. people from Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan and folks from the US) and South Asia (e.g. India, Pakistan). They also run programs that focus on American cities experiencing cultural conflict. </p>
    <p>At SOP, everyone wears the same thing, eats the same food, does the same camp activites (e.g. swimming in the lake, boating, ropes courses, etc.). In addition, everyone participates in dialogue sessions with people who are on the other side of the conflict.</p>
    <p>I served as the American Delegation Leader in SOP's international camp program and particpated in their program for adults, which mirrored the program for young people. </p>
