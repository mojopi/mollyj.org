    <h2>Bird Bodies</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Parrot morphology (except for Kakaopos) is constrained by flight. Their bones are light (hollow with criss-crossing struts) and like most birds, they have these air sacs that fill up most of their body. Whereas our lungs are the bellows of our respiratory system, expanding and contracting with our chest muscles to inhale and exhale air, birds have rigid lungs and nine air sacs, which act as their bellows. When a bird expands their chest and breathes in, the air goes into their the big air sacs towards the bag of their body. When they contract their chest muscles and exhale, the air actually goes into their lungs. In their lungs oxygen they need gets into their blood. When they inhale again, the air from the last breath stored in their air sacs goes into their lungs, push in the now stale air in the lungs into air sacs towards the front of their body. And then, during the second exhale, the stale hair goes up the trachea and out of the nostrils. This one way-way conveyer-belt system is much more efficient than our own.
        <br>
        <br> Parrot eyes are similar to ours except their not as spherical and their placement on a parrots head is not forward-facing like our own.
        <br>
        <br> Parrots, and birds in general, are visual creatures like us. However, they often see much more than we do. We have different kinds of light-sensitive cells in the back of our eyeballs, in a layer called the retina. Two of the kinds of photoreceptors we have area called rods and cones. These cells convert light into electric signals, signals our nervous system can use. Light bounces off objects and into the black hole in the middle of our eyeballs. It eventually hits retina. The rods are incredibly sensitive and can be activated by a single photon. When it’s super dark out, our rods are the cells that are helping us see. The cones, the cells that convert light wavelengths into signals that we then perceive as color in our brain — they are not as sensitive as the rods. That’s why we don’t see color at night. Cones are much less sensitive, requiring more photons to activate them. Different cones respond to different wavelengths of light. Some respond to light with short-wavelengths while others respond to medium and longer wavelengths, which we translate into different combinations of red, blue, and green. Like mixing paints, these combinations make up all the colors and shades of color that we see.
        <br>
        <br> None of our cones respond to really short wavelengths of light, like ultraviolet light. However, parrots, have four types of cones. The fourth cone that they have and we lack is activated by kinds of light that are outside of the visual spectrum we see. This doesn’t mean they just see one extra color that we don’t see. It means that they can make many, many more combinations of colors. They aren’t alone in having this 4D view of colors. Some fish (e.g. goldfish), insects, and mammals (e.g. reindeer) see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.
        <br>
        <br> What this means is that if you were staring at a rainbow with a parrot, you’d actually each see the rainbow differently. It’s similar to seeing a rainbow with someone who’s color blind — it’d be much less dramatic for them. In this analogy, we humans are colorblind. Compared to the parrot, we’re similarly colorblind, lack a cone. Humans see seven colors in the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) but a parrot would see ultraviolet, violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red and then more reds... their red cones are more sensitive than ours so they see many more reds than we do. And that’s just a rainbow. In all the objects we humans perceive as colorful, parrots often see so many more colors in those objects because they see the ultraviolet light bouncing off them. This means that parrots are seeing things about each other, and about us, that we don’t see. In a study of budgies, they covered the feathers of males that reflect ultraviolet light with sunscreen, preventing this reflection. Female budgies were not attracted to this UV-free birds.
        <br>
        <br> Not only do parrots attract mates and signal with the color of their feathers, they also signal with the movement of their feathers. Parrots don’t have the same facial muscles we have so they don’t furrow their eyebrows or widen their eyes to express annoyance or surprise. Instead, they change the diameter of their pupil when their excited in a behavior called eye pinning, they flash their crests (the flamboyant feathers cockatoos and cockatiels have on their head)

If you start at 8:26, you’ll hear about how other species may see.. This is a blogpost with cool photographs about how tetrachromats may see: https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/the-artful-brain/alternate_realities

        <br> Yet, despite our anatomical and physiological differences, it seems that parrots and people have converged in our emotional and intellectual capacities.
