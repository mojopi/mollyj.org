<div class="work-description">
                <p>The African Leadership Academy is a school based outside of Johannesburg, South Africa. It focuses on entrepreneurial leadership. I was a facilitator during their summer program, the Global Scholars Program (GSP). </p>
                <p>Our group was from all over the world (e.g. Tibet, Nigeria, Kenya, US). I took people camping, facilitated a service-learning project with a local partner organization, taught a class with ALA's entrepeneurial curriuclum, and acted as a coach for people as they developed and shared a meaningful story about their lives with the group. </p>
